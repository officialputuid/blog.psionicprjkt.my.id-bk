## About ROM
The name ‚Äù Nusantara ‚Äù itself is taken from one of the initials in the country of Indonesia.

The project was started in 2020 by one of the specialist developers in this field, he is Genkzsz11. With the problems with the previous team, he decided to leave and try to change the structural total of his new team by inviting developers from Indonesia who had previously been competent in this field. Initially only a few developers joined, but in time went by finally many Indonesian developers and some developers outside Indonesia tried to register to join the Nusantara Project team.

Nusantara Project is an Android OS provider with many customization features and is lightweight. 100% Free and secure because it uses Android Open Source Project (AOSP) resources.
